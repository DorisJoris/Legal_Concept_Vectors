# Legal_Concept_Vectors
This project is part of my thesis "The Usability of Legal-Concept-Vectors for data driven legal analysis".

I'm using a graph structure of document-elements to represent legal documents as interconnected legal concepts and use the Word Mover Distance (Kusner et al. 2015) 
to find the closest legal concept to an input text.
